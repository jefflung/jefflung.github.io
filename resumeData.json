    "bio":"I am an experienced designer who has worked in different posts before, like Graphic Designer, Multimedia Designer and Web Designer through my 20 years career life. The first company I worked for was an Advertising company in Hong Kong. I learnt a lot of basic knowledge from this work in the almost 9 years work time, from Graphic Design, Web Design and Development, Animation, and Video editing. Moreover, the second company was a corporate in medical business in Hong Kong, and I have learnt the substantial design experience for a large scale company group. Furthermore, my latest work position was a Web Designer which provided me a chance to work with web technology on the Front-end part.",
    "bio2":"I am competent with most of the Adobe suite softwares, like Photoshop, Illustrator, Aftereffect, Animate and Dreamweaver. Moreover, I also worked by using Maya, from modelling to the rendering procedures.",
    "bio3":"In my pastime, I like to explore up-to-date techniques of website coding because I enjoy to express the aesthetics through the web media, such as animation and the website layout. In fact, I was inspired to enter the Design field by viewing a website of my favourite designer, Eric Jordan, in 2000. His website '2Advanced V3' is composited with techy visual style and some impressive cyber animations for opening and web pages transition, and this kind of aesthetics is still what I prefer for design.",
    "bio4":"On the other hand, I love movie and video game as well. The other person I admire a lot is a Japanese video game creator, Hideo Kojima, as he is a pioneer combining video game interaction into a deeply story telling approach. Through playing Kojima's Metal Gear Solid series, I started to concentrate more on storytelling and camera work in video game, and GTA from episode IV is also my favourite. Afterwards, I enjoy immerse myself in video game with a convoluted plot and compelling dialogues, because I could experience with movie in a playful way and this is immersive for me to another world. All in all, I believe as a designer, we could convey our message with different kind of media such as website, video, game with some sort of storytelling approach.",
    "bio5":"Otherwise, I like doing exercise like jogging and Tai Chi also. As I could sweat a lot while I am jogging and this could rejuvenate my mind and body, while Tai Chi could help my mind to be refreshed and staying calm which could help a better state for work.",
