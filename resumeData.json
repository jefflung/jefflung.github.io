    "bio":"An experienced web designer. I completed a Software Development Bootcamp course with JustIT in January 2023. I am looking for a role of Web Design. Besides, I am also seeking a junior role as a route into the UX Design industry. I am eager to learn from experienced UX Designers and to learn new tools, technologies and methodologies, in order to become an effective member of a UX Design team.",
    "bio2":"I am competent with most of the Adobe suite softwares, like Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, Aftereffect, Animate and Dreamweaver. Moreover, I also worked by using Maya, from modelling to the rendering procedures. For coding languages, I am familiar with HTML, CSS, Jquery. I am still improving my JavaScript and ReactJs knowledge.",
    
    "bio4":"On the other hand, I love movie and video game as well. The other person I admire a lot is a Japanese video game creator, Hideo Kojima, as he is a pioneer combining video game interaction into a deeply story telling approach. Through playing Kojima's Metal Gear Solid series, I started to concentrate more on storytelling and camera work in video game, and GTA from episode IV is also my favourite. Afterwards, I enjoy immerse myself in video game with a convoluted plot and compelling dialogues, because I could experience with movie in a playful way and this is immersive for me to another world. All in all, I believe as a designer, we could convey our message with different kind of media such as website, video, game with some sort of storytelling approach.",
    "bio5":"Otherwise, I like doing exercise like jogging and Tai Chi also. As I could sweat a lot while I am jogging and this could rejuvenate my mind and body, while Tai Chi could help my mind to be refreshed and staying calm which could help a better state for work.",
